    "A crucial quantity of interest when discussing codes, is their distance. The distance determines the number of errors that can be corrected. Whenever an error occurs on a codeword $\\vec{c}$, it creates a corrupted codeword $\\vec{\\tilde{c}}$ that is at some 'distance' away from the $\\vec{c}$. If the distance is small, then it is still possible to correct the error, but if the distance is larger than some value, than the error cannot be corrected. The threshold value is called the distance of the code. We formalize it below."
