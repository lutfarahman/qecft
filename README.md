# Quantum Error Correction

## Introduction  
This project explores quantum error correction and stabilization codes through the mini-book 'An Introduction to Quantum Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation' by Abdullah Khalid. Our goal is to understand and implement concepts from the book effectively. The book includes 'On-Paper' and 'Coding' tasks in every chapter which we tried to solve in our way. It requires knowledge of quantum mechanics, python, and qiskit programming. 

The starter code can be found in the original repo: https://github.com/abdullahkhalids/qecft

## Languages  
Python and Qiskit are used to solve codes.  


## Acknowledgements  
All the contents and exercises in the book have been developed by Abdullah Khalid.
