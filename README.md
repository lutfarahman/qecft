# Quantum Error Correction

## Introduction  
This project explores quantum error correction and stabilizer codes through the mini-book 'An Introduction to Quantum Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation' by Abdullah Khalid. We aim to grasp and practically apply the book’s concepts. The journey started as an extension of QWorld’s internship program, QIntern 2022, under the mentorship of Rajiv Krishnakumar. That served as an entrance door to stabilizer circuits and Clifford-based circuit simulations. Subsequently, we collaborated, and the mini-book seemed to be an excellent starting point. Each chapter includes “On-Paper” and “Coding” tasks that we attempted to solve in our own way. The materials require knowledge of quantum mechanics, Python, and Qiskit programming.

## About me
Hi there, I’m Lutfa Rahman, an MSc Physics student at Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh. What began as a quarantine hobby—delving into quantum computing—has grown into a focused pursuit. In 2020–2021, I completed The Coding School’s Introduction to Quantum Computing course, then joined QWorld’s workshops QBronze (2020) and QSilver (2021) and the QIntern ’22 internship. More recently, I’ve been studying quantum error correction and stabilizer codes. In addition to these interests, my academic research focuses on nonlinear dynamics in plasma physics. I have one published paper, with several works in progress. If you’re interested, you can view my paper here: https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0299945.

## Tools  
Python and Qiskit are used to solve codes.
