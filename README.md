# Quantum Error Correction

## Introduction  
This project explores quantum error correction and stabilizer codes through the mini-book 'An Introduction to Quantum Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation' by Abdullah Khalid. We aim to grasp and practically apply the book’s concepts. The journey started as an extension of QWorld’s internship program, QIntern 2022, under the mentorship of Rajiv Krishnakumar. That served as an entrance door to stabilizer circuits and Clifford-based circuit simulations. Subsequently, we collaborated, and the mini-book seemed to be an excellent starting point. Each chapter includes “On-Paper” and “Coding” tasks that we attempted to solve in our own way. It requires the knowledge of quantum mechanics, Python, and Qiskit programming. 

The starter code can be found in the original repo: https://github.com/abdullahkhalids/qecft



## Languages  
Python and Qiskit are used to solve codes.  


## Acknowledgements
